Question
---
Alyssa's program is incomplete because she has not specified the implementation of the interval abstraction.  Here is a definition of the interval constructor:
``(define (make-interval a b) (cons a b))``

Define selectors upper-bound and lower-bound to complete
the implementation.

Solution
---
Note that what `make-interval` yields is a _pair_ object; therefore, the required selectors can be implemented in terms of pair's selectors, i.e. `car`, and `cdr`.

```scheme
(define (lower-bound interval) (car interval))
(define (upper-bound interval) (cdr interval))
```
