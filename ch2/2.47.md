Question
---
Here are two possible constructors for frames:

```scheme
(define (make-frame origin edge1 edge2)
  (list origin edge1 edge2))
(define (make-frame origin edge1 edge2)
  (cons origin (cons edge1 edge2)))
```

For each constructor supply the appropriate selectors to produce an implementation for frames.

Solution
---
For the first option, we have the following definitions:
```scheme
(define (origin-frame frame) (car frame))
(define (edge1-frame frame) (cadr frame))
(define (edge2-frame frame) (caddr frame))
```

whereas the following defines the selectors for the second option:
```scheme
(define (origin-frame frame) (car frame))
(define (edge1-frame frame) (cadr frame))
(define (edge2-frame frame) (cdr (cdr frame)))
```

Note that the only difference is in the definition of `edge2-frame` where `caddr` cannot be used when the frame is represented as a nested `cons`
