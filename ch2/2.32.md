Question

We can represent a set as a list of distinct elements, and we can represent the set of all subsets of the set as a list of lists. For example, if the set is (1 2 3), then the set of all subsets is (() (3) (2) (2 3) (1) (1 3) (1 2) (1 2 3)). Complete the following definition of a procedure that generates the set of subsets of a set and give a clear explanation of why it works:

```scheme
(define (subsets s)
    (if (null? s)
        (list nil)
        (let ((rest (subsets (cdr s))))
            (append rest (map ⟨??⟩ rest)))))
```

Solution

```scheme
(define (subsets s)
  (if (null? s)
      (list nil)
      (let ((rest (subsets (cdr s))))
        (append rest (map (lambda (subset) (cons (car s) subset)) rest)))))
```
There are two parts to this: 1) `rest` represents the set of subsets of `(cdr s)`, 2) the sets produced by prepending the first element of `s` in each of these subsets are also the subsets of the `s`. This second part is what the `map` produces.
