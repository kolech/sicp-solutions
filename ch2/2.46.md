Question
---
A two-dimensional vector **v** running from the origin to a point can be represented as a pair consisting of an $x$-coordinate and a $y$-coordinate. Implement a data abstraction for vectors by giving a constructor `make-vect` and corresponding selectors `xcor-vect` and `ycor-vect`. In terms of your selectors and constructor, implement procedures `add-vect`, `sub-vect`, and `scale-vect` that perform the operations vector addition, vector subtraction, and multiplying a vector by a scalar:

$$
    (x1 , y1) + (x2 , y2) = (x1 + x2 , y1 + y2), \\
    (x1 , y1) - (x2 , y2) = (x1 - x2 , y1 - y2), \\
    s . (x , y) = (sx , sy):
$$

Solution

```scheme
(define (make-vect x y) (cons x y))
(define (xcor-vect v) (car v))
(define (ycor-vect v) (cdr v))

(define (add-vect v1 v2)
  (let ((x (+ (xcor-vect v1) (xcor-vect v2)))
        (y (+ (ycor-vect v1) (ycor-vect v2))))
    (make-vect x y)))

(define (sub-vect v1 v2)
  (let ((x (- (xcor-vect v1) (xcor-vect v2)))
        (y (- (ycor-vect v1) (ycor-vect v2))))
    (make-vect x y)))

(define (scale-vect s v)
  (let ((x (* s (xcor-vect v)))
        (y (* s (ycor-vect v))))
    (make-vect x y)))
```
