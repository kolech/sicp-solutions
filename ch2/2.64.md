The following procedure `list->tree` converts an ordered list to a balanced binary tree. The helper procedure `partial-tree` takes as arguments an integer n and list of at least $n$ elements and constructs a balanced tree containing the first $n$ elements of the list. The result returned by `partial-tree` is a pair (formed with `cons`) whose `car` is the constructed tree and whose `cdr` is the list of elements not included in the tree.

```scheme
(define (list->tree elements)
  (car (partial-tree elements (length elements))))

(define (partial-tree elts n)
  (if (= n 0)
      (cons '() elts)
      (let ((left-size (quotient (- n 1) 2)))
        (let ((left-result
               (partial-tree elts left-size)))
          (let ((left-tree (car left-result))
                (non-left-elts (cdr left-result))
                (right-size (- n (+ left-size 1))))
            (let ((this-entry (car non-left-elts))
                  (right-result
                   (partial-tree
                    (cdr non-left-elts)
                    right-size)))
              (let ((right-tree (car right-result))
                    (remaining-elts
                     (cdr right-result)))
                (cons (make-tree this-entry
                                 left-tree
                                 right-tree)
                      remaining-elts))))))))
```
a. Write a short paragraph explaining as clearly as you can how `partial-tree` works. Draw the tree produced by `list->tree` for the list `(1 3 5 7 9 11)`.

b. What is the order of growth in the number of steps required by `list->tree` to convert a list of $n$ elements?

Solution
---
`partial-tree` divides the given list into three parts, 1) the first half of the list, 2) the middle item of the list, and 3) the second half of the list. Note that both of the sublists do not contain the middle item. The index of the middle item is calculated as ${\lfloor{n-1 \over 2}\rfloor}$, where $n$ is the number of items to consider in the list. Then it applies `partial-tree` on both sublists, which returns `left-result` and `right-result`, respectively. Finally, it returns `(make-tree mid-item (car left-result) (car right-result))`.

`list-tree` on `(1 3 5 7 9 11)` produces the following tree:
<pre>
       5
     /   \
   1       9
    \    /   \
     3 7      11
</pre>

b. Each step of the procedure involves performing constant-time operations, and applying the procedure to the two sublists; hence, the cost is given by $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + c$, which is $\Theta(nlogn)$
