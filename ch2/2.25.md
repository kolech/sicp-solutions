Question
---
Give combinations of cars and cdrs that will pick 7 from each of the following lists:

```scheme
(1 3 (5 7) 9)
((7))
(1 (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7))))))
```

Solution
---
Let _l_ represent the under consideration; therefore, 7 will be picked from _l_ as follows:

```scheme
(car (cdr (car (cdr (cdr l)))))   ; or (car (cdaddr l))
(car (car l))                     ; or (caar l)
(car (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr lst)))))))))))))   ; or (car (cadadr (cadadr (cadadr lst))))
```
