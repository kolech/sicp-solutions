Question

Evaluating a polynomial in $x$ at a given value of $x$ can be formulated as an accumulation. We evaluate the polynomial

${a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + . . . + a_1x + a_0}$

using a well-known algorithm called _Horner's rule_, which structures the computation as

${(. . . (a_{n}x + a_{n-1})x + . . . + a_1)x + a_0}$

In other words, we start with $a_{n}$, multiply by $x$, add $a_{n-1}$, multiply by $x$, and so on, until we reach $a_{0}$.

Fill in the following template to produce a procedure that
evaluates a polynomial using Horner's rule. Assume that
the coefficients of the polynomial are arranged in a sequence,
from $a_{0}$ through $a_{n}.

```scheme
(define (horner-eval x coefficient-sequence)
    (accumulate (lambda (this-coeff higher-terms) ⟨??⟩)
                0
                coefficient-sequence))
```

Solution

```scheme
(define (horner-eval x coefficient-sequence)
  (accumulate (lambda (this-coeff higher-terms) (+ this-coeff (* higher-terms x)))
              0
              coefficient-sequence))
```
