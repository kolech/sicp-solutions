Question
---
Write a procedure `fringe` that takes as argument a tree (represented as a list) and returns a list whose
elements are all the leaves of the tree arranged in left-to-right order. For example,

```
(define x (list (list 1 2) (list 3 4)))
(fringe x)
(1 2 3 4)
(fringe (list x x))
(1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4)
```

Solution
---
Structurally the procedure is similar to `deep-reverse` in Exercise 2.27, with the only difference being how a list item which is a list is treated.

```scheme
(define (fringe items)
  (define (fringe-iter acc subitems)
    (if (null? subitems)
        acc
        (let ((first-item (car subitems))
              (rest (cdr subitems)))
          (cond ((not (pair? first-item)) (fringe-iter (cons first-item acc) rest))
                (else
                 (let ((left-leaves (fringe first-item)))
                   (fringe-iter (fringe-iter acc left-leaves) rest)))))))

  (reverse (fringe-iter nil items)))
```

Note that the final result has to be reversed since `fringe-iter` accumulates the leaves in a reverse order
