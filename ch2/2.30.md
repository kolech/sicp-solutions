Define a procedure `square-tree` analogous to the square-list procedure of Exercise 2.21. That is, `square-tree` should behave as follows:

```scheme
(square-tree
    (list 1 (list 2 (list 3 4) 5) (list 6 7)))
(1 (4 (9 16) 25) (36 49))
```

Define `square-tree` both directly (i.e., without using any
higher-order procedures) and also by using map and recursion.

Solution

```scheme
(define (square-tree-recursive tree)
  (cond ((null? tree) nil)
        ((not (pair? tree)) (square tree))
        (else (cons (square-tree-recursive (car tree))
                    (square-tree-recursive (cdr tree))))
        )
  )

(define (square-tree-map tree)
  (map (lambda (subtree) (
                          if (not (pair? subtree))
                             (square subtree)
                             (square-tree-map subtree))) tree))
```
