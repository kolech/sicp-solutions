Question
---
Modify your `reverse` procedure of Exercise 2.18 to produce a deep-reverse procedure that takes a list as argument and returns as its value the list with its elements reversed and with all sublists deep-reversed as well. For example,

```scheme
(define x (list (list 1 2) (list 3 4)))
x
((1 2) (3 4))
(reverse x)
((3 4) (1 2))
(deep-reverse x)
((4 3) (2 1))
```

Solution
---
Deep reverse can be applied to a list by iterating through the list, and for each element which is not a list, prepend it to the accumulator; otherwise, apply deep-reverse to it, and prepend the returned list it to the accumulator.

```scheme
(define (deep-reverse items)
  (define (reverse-iter acc subitems)
    (if (null? subitems)
        acc
        (let ((f (car subitems)))
          (if (not (pair? f))
              (reverse-iter (cons f acc) (cdr subitems))
              (reverse-iter (cons (deep-reverse f) acc) (cdr subitems))))))

  (reverse-iter nil items))
```
