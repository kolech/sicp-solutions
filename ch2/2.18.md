Question

Define a procedure reverse that takes a list as argument and returns a list of the same elements in reverse order.

Solution
---
This can be achieved by cdring the list and appending it to the list of its first element. 

```scheme
(define (reverse items)
  (define (reverse-iter acc subitems)
    (if (null? subitems)
        acc
        (reverse-iter (cons (car subitems) acc) (cdr subitems))))
  (reverse-iter (list) items))
```
