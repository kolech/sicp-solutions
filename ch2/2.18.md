Question

Define a procedure reverse that takes a list as argument and returns a list of the same elements in reverse order.

Solution
---
This can be achieved by cdring the list and appending it to the list of its first element. 

```scheme
(define (reverse items)
  (if (= 2 (length items))
      (list (cadr items) (car items))
      (append (reverse (cdr items)) (list (car items)))))
```
