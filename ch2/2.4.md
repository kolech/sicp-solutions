Question
---
Here is an alternative procedural representation of pairs. For this representation, verify that `(car (cons x y))` yields `x` for any object `x` and `y`.

```scheme
(define (cons x y)
    (lambda (m) (m x y)))
(define (car z)
    (z (lambda (p q) p)))
```

What is the corresponding definition of `cdr`? (Hint: To verify that this works, make use of the substitution model of Section 1.1.5)

Solution
----
What `cons` does is simply yield an anonymous procedure which takes a procedure as its argument, i.e., `m`, and applys it to the parameters of `cons`. Note that `m` is any procedure that can be invoked with two arguments. Therefore, `car` needs to define such a procedure, which yields its first parameter when invoked, and invoke the result of `cons` with it. `cdr` can implemented in similar fashion as follows:

```scheme
(define (cdr z) 
    (z (lambda (p q) q)))
```
