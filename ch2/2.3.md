Question
--------
Implement a representation for rectangles in a plane. (Hint: You may want to
make use of Exercise 2.2.) In terms of your constructors and selectors, create
procedures that compute the perimeter and the area of a given rectangle. Now
implement a different representation for rectangles. Can you design your system
with suitable abstraction barriers, so that the same perimeter and area
procedures will work using either representation?

Solution
--------
A rectangle in a plane can be represented at least in two ways: 1) as a pair of
points that represents the top-left and the bottom-right corners of the
rectangle, 2) as a pair of a point for its origin and a pair of its width and
its height.

If we have two selectors that return the width and the height of the rectangle,
then irrespective of how the rectangle is represented, the procedures to
calculate its area and perimeter will remain unchanged.

An implementation of the rectangle package is defined [here](rectangle.rkt)
