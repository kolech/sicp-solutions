Question
---
`right-split` and `up-split` can be expressed as instances of a general splitting operation. Define a procedure `split` with the property that evaluating

```scheme
(define right-split (split beside below))
(define up-split (split below beside))
```
produces procedures `right-split` and `up-split` with the same behaviors as the ones already defined.

Solution
---
Below is the definitions of `right-split` and `up-split`

```scheme
(define (up-split painter n)
  (if (= n 0)
      painter
      (let ((smaller (up-split painter (- n 1))))
        (below painter (beside smaller smaller)))))

(define (right-split painter n)
  (if (= n 0)
      painter
      (let ((smaller (right-split painter (- n 1))))
        (beside painter (below smaller smaller)))))
```

Note that the only difference between these definitions is the order in which `below` and `beside` are applied to the painters. Therefore, by naming _outer_ the procedure that is applied last, and _inner_ the one that is applied first, `split` can be defined as follows:

```scheme
(define (split outer inner)
  (define (splitter painter n)
    (if (= n 0)
        painter
        (let ((smaller (splitter painter (- n 1))))
          (outer painter (inner smaller smaller))))))
```
