Question

The `accumulate` procedure is also known as _fold-right_, because it combines the first element of the sequence with the result of combining all the elements to the right. There is also a _fold-left_, which is similar to _fold-right, except that it combines elements working in the opposite direction:

```scheme
(define (fold-left op initial sequence)
    (define (iter result rest)
        (if (null? rest)
            result
            (iter (op result (car rest)) (cdr rest))))
(iter initial sequence))
```

What are the values of
```scheme
(fold-right / 1 (list 1 2 3))
(fold-left / 1 (list 1 2 3))
(fold-right list nil (list 1 2 3))
(fold-left list nil (list 1 2 3))
```

Give a property that `op` should satisfy to guarantee that fold-right and fold-left will produce the same values for any sequence.


Solution

```scheme
(fold-right / 1 (list 1 2 3))       ; (1 / (2 / 3)) = 3/2
(fold-left / 1 (list 1 2 3))        ; ((1/2) / 3)   = 1/6
(fold-right list nil (list 1 2 3))  ; (1 (2 (3 ())))
(fold-left list nil (list 1 2 3))   ; (((() 1) 2) 3)
```

`op` has to be commutative, i.e. the order of its operands doesn't have any effect on its final result.
