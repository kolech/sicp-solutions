Question
---
Write a procedure to find all ordered triples of distinct positive integers $i$, $j$, and $k$ less than or equal to a given integer $n$ that sum to a given integer $s$.

Solution
---
The structure of the procedure to enumerate the ordered triples is almost identical to `unique-pairs` except that this procedure adds a third nested mapping. It can be thought of as a nested `flatmap` invocations.

```scheme
(define (unique-triples n)
  (flatmap (lambda (i)
             (flatmap (lambda (j)
                        (map (lambda (k)
                               (list k j i))
                             (enumerate-interval 1 (- j 1))))
                      (enumerate-interval 1 (- i 1))))
           (enumerate-interval 1 n)))

(define (matching-sum-triples n s)
  (filter (lambda (l) (= s (+ (car l) (cadr l) (caddr l)))) (unique-triples n)))
```
