Question
---
Show that we can represent pairs of nonnegative integers using only numbers and arithmetic operations if we represent the pair `a` and `b` as the integer that is the product $2^a3^b$. Give the corresponding definitions of the procedures `cons`, `car`, and `cdr`.

Solution
---
`cons` can be defined such that it yields the product $2^a3^b$. Given such a product `p`, `car` has to successively divide `p` until it gets to an odd integer, and yield the number of divisions. Now that we know how to get to `a` from `p`, `cdr` just needs to compute $log_3{p \over 2^a}$ to yield `b`. Note that both `car` and `cdr` accept any integer; therefore, they need to make sure that it is the product $2^a3^b$.


```scheme
(define (odd? n)
  (> (remainder n 2) 0))

(define (cons a b)
  (* (expt 2 a) (expt 3 b)))

(define (car p)
  (define (car_iter i n)
    (cond ((> n 0) (if (odd? n) i (car_iter (+ i 1) (/ n 2))))
          (else (error "argument not a valid product" p))))
  (car_iter 0 p))

(define (cdr p)
  (let ((first-part (expt 2 (car p))))
    (let ((second-part (/ p first-part)))
      (let ((b (log second-part 3)))
        (if (= (floor b) b) b (error "argument not a valid product" p))))))
