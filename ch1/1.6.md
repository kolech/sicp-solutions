Question
--------
Alyssa P. Hacker doesn't see why `if` needs to be provided as a special form.
"Why can't I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of `cond`?" she
asks. Alyssa's friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she
defines a new version of `if`:

```scheme
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
    (cond (predicate then-clause)
          (else else-clause)))
```
Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:
```scheme
(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
```
_5_

```scheme
(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
```
_0_

Delighted, Alyssa uses `new-if` to rewrite the square-root program:

```scheme
(define (sqrt-root guess x)
    (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
            guess
            (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
```

What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots? Explain.

Solution
--------
Alyssa will find the interpreter in an infinite loop because of the following
reasoning.

The new procedure will not work if any one of the arguments is an evaluation of
a recursive procedure that does not terminate. Both in a normal-order evaluation
and in an applicative-order evaluation, all the arguments to `new-if` have to be
evaluated eventually, contrary to what happens in the primitive `if` procedure.

In the new implementation of `sqrt-iter`, the second argument to `new-if`, i.e.,
`(sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)`, gets evaluated irrespective of the result of
the predicate, in turn, invokes itself ad infinitum.
