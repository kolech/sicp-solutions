Question
--------        
Simpson's Rule is a more accurate method of numerical integration than the
method illustrated above. Using Simpson's Rule, the integral of a function $f$
between $a$ and $b$ is approximated as

$$
{h \over 3}(y_{0} + 4y_{1} + 2y_{2} + 4y_{3} + 2y_{4} + ... + 2y_{n-2} + 4y_{n-1} + y_{n}),
$$

where $h = (b - a)/n$, for some even integer $n$, and $y_{k} = f(a+kh)$.
(Increasing $n$ increases the accuracy of the approximation.)

Define a procedure that takes as arguments $f$, $a$, $b$, and $n$ and the
returns the value of the integral, computed using Simpson's Rule. Use your
procedure to integrate cube between 0 and 1 (with $n$ = 100 and $n$ = 1000),
and compare the results to those of the integral procedure shown above.

Solution
--------
Notice that the approximation can also be expressed as

$$
{h \over 3}(y_{0} + 4(y_{1} +  y_{3} + ... + y_{n-1}) + 2(y_{2} + y_{4} + ... + y_{n-2})  + y_{n}),
$$

From the definition of $h$ we note that the term $a + kh$ is always less than $b$
when $k < n$. This implies that we can make use of the `sum` procedure for
the inner partial sums without adding extra terms.


```scheme
(define (integral f a b n)
  (define (h) (/ (* 1.0 (- b a)) n))

  (define (double-h) (* 2 (h)))

  (define (next x) (+ x (double-h)))

  (define (summer x)
    (sum f x next b))

  (/ (* (h)
        (+ (f a)
           (* 4 (summer (+ a (h))))
           (* 2 (summer (+ a (double-h))))
           (f (+ a (* n (h))))))         
     3))
```

The table below shows how the two algorithms compare with each other.

$$\begin{array} {|l|l|l|}
    \hline n & older & newer \\
    \hline 100 & 0.24998750000000042 &  0.2500000000000004\\
    \hline 1000 & 0.249999875000001 &  0.25000000000000083\\
    \hline
\end{array}$$
