Question
--------
The `smallest-divisor` procedure shown at the start of this section does lots
of needless testing: After it checks to see if the number is divisible by 2
there is no point in checking to see if it is divisible by any larger even
numbers.  This suggests that the values used for `test-divisor` should not be
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., but rather 2, 3, 5, 7, 9,...  To implement this change,
define a procedure `next` that returns 3 if its input is equal to 2 and
otherwise returns its input plus 2. Modify the `smallest-divisor` procedure to
use `(next test-divisor)` instead of `(+ test-divisor 1)`. With
`timed-prime-test` incorporating this modified version of `smallest-divisor`,
run the test for each of the 12 primes found in Exercise 1.22. Since this
modification halves the number of test steps, you should expect it to run about
twice as fast. Is this expectation confirmed? If not, what is the observed
ratio of the speeds of the two algorithms, and how do you explain the fact that
it is different from 2?

Solution
--------
The proposed procedure can be written as follows:
```scheme
(define (next n)
  (if (= n 2) 3 (+ n 2)))
```

The table below compares the run times between the old version and the new
version of the algorithm.

$$\begin{array} {|l|l|l|l|}
    \hline n & old\ run\ time & improved\ run\ time &
    average\ steps \\
    \hline 1000 & 2.7 & 2.59 & 32 \\
    \hline 10000 & 6.36  & 5.33 & 100 \\
    \hline 100000 & 17.68  & 14.32 & 316 \\
    \hline 1000000 & 54.48 & 42.96 & 1000 \\
    \hline
\end{array}$$

The improved algorithm effectively halves the input; therfore, we should expect
to see an improvement in the average run time by a factor of $\sqrt {1/2}
\approx 0.707$.

Here, as well, as the input size increases so does that the improvement gets
closer to 0.707.
