Question
--------

Define a procedure that takes three numbers and returns the sum of the squares
of the two larger numbers.

Solution
--------
```scheme
(define (max x y) (if (> x y) x y))
(define (square x) (* x x))
(define (sum-of-squares x y) (+ (square x) (square y)))
(define (f x y z) (sum-of-squares (max x y) (max (max x y) z)))
```
