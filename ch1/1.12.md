Question
--------
The following patterns of numbers are called _Pascal's triangle_.

$$
\begin{array}{c}
1 \\
1 \quad 1 \\
1 \quad 2 \quad 1 \\
1 \quad 3 \quad 3 \quad 1 \\
1 \quad 4 \quad 6 \quad 4 \quad 1 \\
. \quad . \quad . \\
\end{array}
$$

The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and each number inside
the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it. Write a procedure that
computes elements of Pascal's triangle by means of a recursive process.

Solution
--------
An element in the triangle can be identified by a pair of integers, _i_ and _j_,
which represent its row and column indices, respectively, in the triangle. The
following recursive mathematical definition can be used to get the element at
$i^{th}$ row and the $j^{th}$ column.

$$
    f(i, j) = 
    \begin{cases}
    1, & \text{if i = 1 and j = 1} \\
    0, & \text{if i < 0 or j < 0} \\
    f(i-1, j) + f(i-1, j-1),& \text {otherwise}
    \end{cases}
$$

A recursive procedure for the above definition can be written as follows:

```scheme
(define (f i j)
    (cond ((and (= i 1) (= j 1)) 1)
          ((or (< i 0) (< j 0)) 0)
          (else (+ (f (- i 1) j) (+ (f (- i 1) (- j 1)))))))
```
