Question
--------
Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if _y_ is an
approximation to the cube root of _x_, then a better approximation is given
by the value $${{x \over y^2} + 2y} \over 3$$ Use this formula to implement a
cube-root procedure analogous to the square-root procedure. (In Section 1.3.4
we will see how to implement Newton's method in general as an abstraction of
these square-root and cube-root procedures.)

Solution
--------
The cube-root procedure can be used almost as it is by simply changing the
implementation of `improve` procedure.

```scheme
(define (square x) (* x x))

(define (sum x y) (+ x y))

(define (improve guess x)
    ( / (sum (/ x (square guess)) (* 2 guess)) 3))

(define (frac prev-guess curr-guess)
    (/ (- curr-guess prev-guess)
       prev-guess))

(define (good-enough? prev-guess curr-guess)
    (< (abs (frac prev-guess curr-guess))
       0.001))

(define (cube-root-iter prev-guess curr-guess x)
    (if (good-enough? prev-guess curr-guess)
        curr-guess
        (cube-root-iter curr-guess
                   (improve curr-guess x)
                   x)))
(define (cube-root x)
    (cube-root-iter 1.0 2.0 x))
```
