Question
--------
Each of the following two procedures defines a mehtod for adding two positive
integers in terms of the procedures `inc`, which increments its argument by _1_,
and `dec`, which decrements its argument by _1_.

```scheme
(define (+ a b)
    (if (= a 0 ) b (inc (+ (dec a) b)))

(define (+ a b)
    (if (= a 0 ) b (+ (dec a)  (inc b))))
```

Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure
in evaluating `(+ 4 5)`. Are these processes interative or recursive?

Solution
--------
The following are illustrations of the processes generated by the first and the
second procedures, respectively.

```scheme
; illustration of the second process
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9

; illustration of the first process
(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)
9
```

The first process has defered operations, namely, the ones performed by `inc`;
therefore, this makes it a recursive process. However, the second process
doesn't have any deferred operation, which makes it an iterative process.
