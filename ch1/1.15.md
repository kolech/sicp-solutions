Question
--------
The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed by making use of
the approximation $sinx \approx x$ if $x$ is sufficiently small, and the
trigonometric identity

$$
    sin x = 3 sin{x \over 3} - 4 sin^3{x \over 3}
$$

to reduce the size of the argument of sin. (For purposes of this exercise an
angle is considered "sufficiently small" if its magnitude is not greater than
0.1 radians.) These ideas are incorporated in the following procedures:

```scheme
(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (sine angle)
    (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
        angle
        (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
```

1. How many times is the procedure `p` applied when `(sine 12.15)` is evaluated?
2. What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of 
$a$) used by the process generated by the `sine` procedure when `(sine a)` is
evaluated?

Solution
--------
1. The procedure `p` is applied recursively as long as the argument is not 
less than or equal to 0.1. To arrive at this threshold, we need to divide 12.15
by 3 at least 5 times.

    In general, for any given $x$, we need to solve for the smallest integer $m$
    that satisfies the following inequality: $${ x \over 3^m} \le 0.1$$
    Therefore, $m = \lceil log_3{x \over 0.1} \rceil$

2. Both orders of growth are proportional to the number of divisions, i.e. $\Theta(m)$.
