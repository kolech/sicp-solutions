Question
--------

You can obtain an even more general version of `accumulate` (Exercise 1.32) by
introducing the notion of a filter on the terms to be combined. That is,
combine only those terms derived from values in the range that satisfy a
specified condition. The resulting `filtered-accumulate` abstraction takes the
same arguments as accumulate, together with an additional predicate of one
argument that specifies the filter. Write `filtered-accumulate` as a procedure.
Show how to express the following using `filtered-accumulate`: 

a. the sum of the squares of the prime numbers in the interval $a$ to $b$
   (assuming that you have a `prime?` predicate already written)

b. the product of all the positive integers less than $n$ that are
   relatively prime to $n$ (i.e., all positive integers $i < n$ such that
   `GCD(i, n) = 1`)

Solution
--------
```scheme
(define (filtered-accumulate combiner filter null-value term a next b)
  (define (iter a result)
    (if (> a b)
        result
        (if (filter (term a))
            (iter (next a) (combiner result (term a)))
            (iter (next a) result))))

  (iter a null-value))

(define (sum-primes-squared a b)
  (filtered-accumulate add prime? 0 identity a inc b))

(define (add a b) (+ a b))

(define (identity x) x)

(define (inc a) (+ a 1))

(define (prod-coprimes n)
  (define (coprime? x)
    (= (gcd n x) 1))

  (filtered-accumulate mult coprime? 1 identity 1 inc n))

(define (mult a b) (* a b))
```
