Question
--------
Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are
compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behaviour of the
following procedure.

```scheme
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
    ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
```

Solution
--------
Thanks to our model of evaluation, the expression
`(if (> b 0) + -)`{:.language-scheme} evaluates to either **+** or **-** based
on the value of _b_, and the result is used as the operator of the combination
of the procedure's body.
