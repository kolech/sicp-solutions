Question
--------
a. Show that `sum` and `product` (Exercise 1.31) are both special cases of a
still more general notion called `accumulate` that combines a collection of
terms, using some general accumulation function:

```scheme
(accumulate combiner null-value term a next b)
```

`accumulate` takes as arguments the same term and range specifications as `sum`
and `product`, together with a combiner procedure (of two arguments) that
specifies how the current term is to be combined with the accumulation of the
preceding terms and a null-value that specifies what base value to use when
their terms run out. Write `accumulate` and show how `sum` and `product` can
both be defined as simple calls to accumulate.

b. If your `accumulate` procedure generates a recursive process, write one
that generates an iterative process. If it generates an interactive process,
write one that generates a recursive process.

Solution
--------
```scheme
; accumulate procedure that generates recursive process
(define (accumulate combiner null-value term a next b)
  (if (> a b)
      null-value
      (combiner (term a)
                (accumulate combiner null-value term (next a) next b))))

; accumulate procedure that generates iterative process
(define (accumulate combiner null-value term a next b)
  (define (iter a result)
    (if (> a b)
        result
        (iter (next a) (combiner result (term a)))))
  (iter a null-value))
```
Now `sum` and `product` can defined as simple calls to `accumulate` as follows:

```scheme
(define (product term a next b)
  (define (mult a b) (* a b))

  (accumulate mult 1 term a next b))

(define (sum term a next b)
  (define (add a b) (* a b))

  (accumulate add 0 term a next b))
```
