Question
---
Consider the following `make-cycle` procedure:

```scheme
(define (make-cycle x)
    (set-cdr! (last-pair x) x)
    x)

(define (last-pair x)
    (if (null? (cdr x))
        x
        (last-pair (cdr x))))
```

Draw a box-and-pointer diagram that shows the structure `z` created by
```
(define z (make-cycle (list 'a 'b 'c)))
```
What happens if we try to compute `(last-pair z)`?

Solution

`(last-pair z)` will not terminate since z it will recursively attempt to get at the its last part which doesn't exist since none of z's pair have a cdr part with that is null.
