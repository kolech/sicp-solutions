Question
---
Ben Bitdiddle decides to write a procedure to count the number of pairs in any
list structure. "It's easy," he reasons. "The number of pairs in any structure is the number in the
car plus the number in the cdr plus one more to count the current pair." So Ben writes the
following procedure:

```scheme
(define (count-pairs x)
  (if (not (pair? x))
      0
      (+ (count-pairs (car x))
         (count-pairs (cdr x))
         1)))
```
Show that this procedure is not correct. In particular, draw box-and-pointer diagrams
representing list structures made up of exactly three pairs for which Ben's procedure would
return 3; return 4; return 7; never return at all.

Solution

The following list structures would return 3, return 4, return 7; return never at all
```scheme
(define w (cons 'a 'b))

(define x (cons w w))
(count-pairs x)

(define y (cons 'a x))
(count-pairs y)

(define z (cons x x))
(count-pairs z)

(set-cdr! z z)
(count-pairs z)
```
