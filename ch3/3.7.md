Question
---
Consider the bank account objects created by make-account, with the password
modification described in exercise 3.3. Suppose that our banking system requires the ability to make
joint accounts. Define a procedure `make-joint` that accomplishes this. `Make-joint` should take
three arguments. The first is a password-protected account. The second argument must match the
password with which the account was defined in order for the `make-joint` operation to proceed.
The third argument is a new password. `Make-joint` is to create an additional access to the original
account using the new password. For example, if `peter-acc` is a bank account with password
`open-sesame`, then
```
(define paul-acc (make-joint peter-acc 'open-sesame 'rosebud))
```
will allow one to make transactions on `peter-acc` using the name `paul-acc` and the password
rosebud. You may wish to modify your solution to exercise 3.3 to accommodate this new feature.

Solution
---
`make-joint` can defined in such a way that it doesn't require any modification in `make-ccount`. Any access to the joint account is protected by the its password while access to the original account is protected by its own password.

```scheme
(define (make-joint joint-acc acc-passwd joint-passwd)
  (define (dispatch p m)
    (if (not (eq? p joint-passwd))
        (error "Incorrect joint password")
        (joint-acc acc-passwd m)))
  dispatch)
```
Example usage
```scheme
(define acc (make-account 100 'open-sesame))
(define joint-acc (make-joint acc 'open-sesame 'rosebud))

((acc 'open-sesame 'withdraw) 70)
((joint-acc 'rosebud 'deposit) 70 )
((acc 'open-sesame 'withdraw) 70) ; this would fail if the above depost weren't made 
```
