Question

Modify the `make-account` procedure of exercise 3.3 by adding another local state
variable so that, if an account is accessed more than seven consecutive times with an incorrect
password, it invokes the procedure `call-the-cops`.

Solution

```scheme
(define (make-account balance password)
  (define (withdraw amount)
    (if (>= balance amount)
        (begin (set! balance (- balance amount))
               balance)
        "Insufficient funds"))
  (define (deposit amount)
    (set! balance (+ balance amount))
    balance)

  (let ((attempts 0))
    (lambda (p m)
      (cond ((not (eq? p password)) (if (= attempts 7)
                                        (error "call-the-cops")
                                        (begin (set! attempts (+ attempts 1))
                                               (display "Incorrect password")
                                               (lambda (x) (newline)))))
            ((eq? m 'withdraw) withdraw)
            ((eq? m 'deposit) deposit)
            (else (error "Unknown request -- MAKE-ACCOUNT" m))))))
```
